# Recognizing Traffic Signs with a Deep Neural Network
This is the second project in Udacity's [Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program](http://udacity.com/drive). In this project I created a neural network in **Tensorflow** on a data set of over 39,000 German traffic sign images.

### How the project is organized
There is a Jupyter notebook called *Traffic_Sign_Classifier* and also an HTML format document of the same name. Apart from that there is an *images* folder which has the 5 additional traffic sign images taken from the internet (I borrowed them from a fellow student) to test the model ourselves.
The rest of the files are checkpoint files which store the model. :)
